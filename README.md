# Handwritten-digit-classification
## Introduction and Motivation
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, formed by Yann LeCun of NYU, has a total of 70,000 examples from approximately 250 writers. The images are 28*28 in size. There are 60,000 images in training test while 10,000 images in the test set. The digits in both the dataset are labeled as any number between 0 to 9. The project aims to implement several classification algorithms namely kNN, logistic regression, SVM, ensemble learning and Convolutional Neural Network for accurate handwritten digit recognition. 

Since the MNIST dataset is quite popular in the research community. I was motivated to know what are the proven ways which we can use to handle this data, apply algorithms and infer the results. At present, there is a wide need for solving problems that involve high dimensional data. The chosen problem is on similar lines and throw opens the opportunity to learn about dimensionality reduction and how to create a visualization to get a sense of the data. This problem allowed us to apply ML algorithm that I learned in the class lectures. As the problem is a highly researched one, it allowed me to know if I have implemented my solution in the right way or not. The right execution solidifies my learning and motivates me to go further in the field of Computer Vision.
